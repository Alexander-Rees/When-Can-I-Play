## What is it?
When Can I Play? serves as a tool for students of Northeastern University to check for times when Carter Field is available for public use. The mechanism for seeing this is incorporated by displaying scheduled intramural & club sports at NEU and the athletic schedules of the Boston Public Schools. When a student decides they’d like to play, no longer do they have to walk all the way to the field just to get kicked off or denied access… now they can check if it’s playable straight from the internet!
